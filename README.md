# Safe Swim Austin

## Problem

It is hard to know when swimming spots and other recreational areas are dangerous to health because of bacteria or other safety hazards.

[Community Impact Newspaper: City of Austin warns residents against swimming in Bull Creek because of high bacteria levels](https://communityimpact.com/austin/northwest-austin/city-county/2016/07/22/city-austin-warns-residents-swimming-bull-creek-high-bacteria-levels/)

## Solution

- Twitter bot with a stream of water quality warnings.
- Map of data collection points with most recent water quality data for each.
